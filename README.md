# Machine Learning - Predicting House Sale Prices

In this project, we'll work with a dataset compiled by [Dean De Cock](http://www.truman.edu/faculty-staff/decock/) on sold houses in Ames, Iowa. We've built models that predict the final sale price from its other attributes. Specifically, we've explored the following questions:
- Which properties of a house most affect the final sale price?
- How effectively can we predict the sale price from just its properties?
